## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the **Intelligent Data Storage & Management (IDSM) Lab**, HUST, advised by Prof. Hua Wang and Prof. Ke Zhou. I obtained the B.E. degree in Hydropower Engineering & Automation from HUST in 2022.

I’m currently working on exploring practical and scalable methods to improve the efficiency and performance of cloud storage systems, and optimizing data-loading pipelines to reduce training stalls and boost end-to-end throughput.

I’m open to collaborations, discussions, or any opportunities to work together on related research ideas—feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaboration or have questions about my work.
